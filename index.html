                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This page, itself, is a project. I wanted to see how 
                    creative I could get with the HTML and CSS I've learned over 
                    the summer. I thought this was a great opportunity to do as much 
                    as I could in order to see how much I really know and attempt to stretch 
                    the limits of what I know and what I can produce at this point in 
                    time.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    The assignment is pretty basic: create a 3-page website. Within that, 
                    the content is ours to create and the structure needed to follow a few 
                    simple guidelines. I wanted to make something personal - not for the sake of 
                    sharing tons of information abotu myself, but because it's the easiest 
                    content to create. 
                </p>

            <section class="blog-post">
                <h2>Why this content?</h2>
                <p>
                    The content I chose for this really fell in line with 
                    having personal content that is easy to create. Since I've just 
                    left Queen's, I thought the past 5 years I spent there would provide 
                    lots of easy content to generate, as well as a cool ability to allow my friends 
                    to be involved in what I'm doing here. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next two pages are about my time at Queen's and some of the people that 
                    made my time at Queen's as great as it was. The first page is an overview of each year 
                    I spent there. I just ahve a simple blog post for each year, along with a small gallery 
                    of images that I went back and found from those years. I wanted to do that 
                    because I thought it would be fun to look through all those memories, but also 
                    because I find self-reflection an important part of life. Essentially, I thought 
                    that page was a good place to reflect on each year at Queen's - given some 
                    distance from Kingston.

                <h2>Overwiew of my time at Queen's</h2>
                <p>
                    I spent five years at Queen's. Not exactly because of an inability to 
                    complete a four year degree in four years, but because Canadian University Athletics 
                    allow for five years of eligibility, so I went into school planning to 
                    use all of my eligibility. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That point brings me to the reason I was drawn to Queen's, and what I 
                    valued when choosing Queen's: the basketball team. It wasn't the on-court 
                    basketball stuff that really drew me in, it was the family I saw between the players 
                    when I was on my visit. Seeing that and knowing it was exactly what I wanted to be 
                    a part of when I was at school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luckily for me, that's what I got. My recruiting class was five players (technically six, 
                    but I don't need to get into that) and we all lived together each year after residence in our 
                    first year. We didn't all play the full five years - only two of the boys made it - but 
                    that was the core and that was the base for the family I felt like we had at QMBB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That core - Ross, Sammy, Tanner and Jesse - make up four of the seven guys I include on the 
                    last page of the website. I wanted to make a space for them to cotnribute to this, so I asked them 
                    along with Vinny, Henry and Jake to send me a paragraph or some sort of post, if they wanted to, so I 
                    could send them the final result with all their posts to see. My thought was that if they choose not to 
                    send me anything I would just add in a little blurb about each of them, since they all 
                    had a significant and positivie impact on my time at Queen's.
