                <h2>Who they are:</h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, these are the dudes that made my experience at Queen's what it was. My housemates and a few of the other guys. It's not everybody, but they each 
                    brought something that was unreplaceable and something I am so happy I got out of it. From the family I feel with the housemates - and the five years we spent together - to 
                    the boys at 83B and my dawg Vinny. These are the mans.

                <h2 class="image-label">Ross</h2>
                <p>
                    My first impression of Ross was that he was a goofy dude. That definitely was an accurate judgement. He's just so open about a lot of things that he 
                    gets himself in hilarious situations with the guys. Our wifi was named Yams a make her dance for 5 whole years because the guy microwaved Yams one time. 
                    The time he fell pretty hard and everybody thought he sounded like a beached whale when he landed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's also a pretty sensitive guy though. definitely a stress machine, but someone who's great to chill with. We spent a ton of time chilling in the 
                    back room of 124 together this past year and a lot of that really let me enjoy the time we stil ahd together, just not really thinking about much but hanging - well that 
                    and playing smash together with all the guys. "Any mans wanna get worked?" will always have a very specific meaning for me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all loved his engineering side - the one that would go to the pole at 5am, or the guy that was a Frek and turned our one shower at the Rat Trap purple. Nobody has ever 
                    fit the bill of "daddy" in a group of 22 year old dudes as well as Ross, and a good steak from BBQ chefmaster Ross was always the best way to end a night or a stressful day of school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm happy Ross is the forst one of us with a full-time job, and he also happens to be the only one that finished his degree in less than 5 years - a long departure from 
                    singing your JJJ's...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regardless, our house would never have had so much character if Ross wasn't there, going on vegan diets for weeks just to cheat and have a Big Mac on 
                    Saturday night. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cheers to the big guy - after all, nobody else can say they had a party themed after them.

                <h2 class="image-label">Sammy</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a lot of respect for Sammy. I don't mean that to say I don't have respect for the other guys, but I've seen Sammy deal with issues none of us have had to.
                    The dude had to deal with Tyler AND  a rat biting him at 248. I've walked downstairs to him doing work at 7am, not because he was up early, but because he didn't sleep. And 
                    that wasn't like a super unusual thing, that's just anxiety. To deal with that and still play basketball - it put into perspective how easy it was for me to just show up and 
                    try my hardest. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That aside, Sammy's also had some of my favourite, funniest moments. The legendary "Sweeter mans looking for fried chicken" snap was one. Also the one summer where 
                    he would get home from work just before Ross, but would wait for Ross to have a pre-practice nap together every day. Just hearing Sammy yell "Daddy, you're home. Time to nap." every 
                    day always made me laugh so much. I also have the memory of talking to Sammy about how we were going to improve after our first year. We started doing everything with our weak hands, even to the point where we were 
                    eating salad at Lenny dinner with our weak hands. His picture of Nate Robinson as the end goal - road to 185. That's stuff I want to remember for as long as possible. 
                    All that little stuff. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also never met anybody with the ability to dive so deeply into certain games. Catan and Fortnite, specifically. The dude would play Catan for 8 hours a day if he could. That one 
                    semester we played every day. and Sammy had so many more wins than everybody else just because he would take the board to Henry and Jake's to play over there when nobody at home 
                    wanted to play. Then fortnite, of course. That lasted like months for everybody else, but he got streaming after about a year of playing (I think that timeline is right?). Regardless, that's 
                    always amazed me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hahahaha one thing about Sammy is that he would always laugh at me when I was in pain, but it was in a good way. The one time, we were in our fourth year. 
                    At this point I was coaching, but I would come in and play in practices if we needed another player. It was Christmas break and I had done that earlier in the day and 
                    hurt my back pretty bad. We were the only two at our student house because Ross was still in Caledon and the Graham's had gone home for the evening. Usually when I would hurt my back it would 
                    tighten up that day and then slowly get better, so later in the day I hurt it would be the most pain I would be in. This particular time is the worst I remember. 
                    Sammy and I watched some movie together (Maybe a Trevor Noah Standup on Netflix?) and I was laying down in his bed for it so I didn't have to use my back while sitting. 
                    While the movie played, however, my back tightened up so badly that I couldn't stand up to leave his room. It took me about 10 minutes of struggling to get off the bed and stand up, with some time spent 
                    struggling, holding onto the doorknob and his small bookcase to help pull me up. He was laughing the entire time, which made me laugh too. Although it isn't ecaxtly fun to get laughed at 
                    while you're in pain, it did make me laugh at myself - something that helps keep a somewhat positive attitude at the very least.

                <h2 class="image-label">Jesse</h2>
                <p>
                    Jesse!!! Hahaha that dude has the most incredible ability to remain on a couch indefinitely. He loves to just chill and it's so apparent in like everything that he 
                    does it's astounding. Although we joked about Sammy's Nest at 124, Jesse had his own too, just it was twice as big. When I think about it though, that chilled back and relexed 
                    feeling is something I always got when I went to his home home - 2 Mallard - so I can see why it's such a big part of him. The summers in Kingston were always a grind, but 
                    having the weekends to go chill by the pool, on the dock or just on the couch for a nap were always key in making it through those summers. We all needed 
                    that time on Sundays.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has two other abilities I think are worth shouting out. Eating and Drawing. Y'all remember the Wallace? And he'd always "Yoink" a fry from me when we went for food together. 
                    He'd finish ANYBODY'S dinner if there were leftovers, and loooooved Sammy's pizza crusts. And the craziest part is that he would eat so much, but the only veggie I consistently saw 
                    him eat was the lettuce in a Caesar Salad. To switch gears a little, he's a crazy good artist, but I guess that comes from his Dad - a professional artist. While we were at school he drew 
                    done of hilrious pictures of us all. From the portrait's in Tanner's room last year to the mural of QMBB at the F Shack on Uni. My favourite, however, was definitely the Beware of Brogres sign that 
                    looks amazingly identical to Shrek's original sign - a tribute to the one and only. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jesse thought it would be worthwhile to give a short guide to my vocabulary:
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was fortunate enough to live with Russell for 4 years during my time at Queen’s university. In that time however, I was able to decipher the many strange noises that accompanied Russell’s speech. We often liked to 
                    poke fun at the various phrases and the onomatopoeia that Russell would weave into normal, Canadian, human speech. Below you will find the various noises, followed by their time of use, a short 
                    definition of the term, and an example in everyday use. Enjoy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Merp (September 2014 – April 2019) – One of the more common Russell phrases “merp” is often used to signal indifference to a given subject. 
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    Example:
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    Jesse: “Hey Russ, want to go to the movies”
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    Russ: *contemplates his bank account of $12.95 “merp… sure”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Styll (September 2014 – April 2019) – Again this isn’t original but when Russell uses the term it is distinctive. The Queen’s men’s basketball team recruits a lot of its players from the Toronto area 
                    and thus it brings a whole subsection of the English language to the locker room. This language has been coined “Toronto mans slang.” To the unqualified ear this can sound like an entirely 
                    different language. However, like many of his teammates outside the GTA, Russell began adopting phrases from the slang language and one of the most noteworthy was the term styll. Styll is 
                    a difficult word to define as it can mean to agree with someone or it can signify a sentence has ended. 
                </p>

                    Russell: “That’s crazy styll.”

                <h2 class="image-label">Tanner</h2>
                <p>
                    For real though, Tanner might be the only housemate I've ever felt really proud of. I don't want that to sound weird, but he's just accomplished so much on the basketball court, while 
                    being such a good student that it amazes me. He's the guy that everybody should aim to be when they enter University sports. The fact that he's playing professionally right now says enough. 
                    That's a goal that almost every USports player has when they start their career, and it pans out that way for so few guys I'm just really proud he's getting that experience - for all of us. 
                    I guess it's not just because he made it there, but because I saw how hard he had to work to get there. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As always, basketball isn't the only thing, though. I guess on the last page I said that my initial impression of Tanner was that he irritated me, for some reason I couldn't figure out. 
                    I still don't know what it is, but he manages to still irritate me. He always makes some stupid, clever (as I'm sure he thinks), remark - then looks at me as if I'm the only one that's paying attention. 
                    I think I'm just the only one that acknowledges it. Regardless, we've jsut gotten along really well ever since first year, when we would go around Vic Hall and walk into random parties on nights when we weren't drinking, 
                    just to see what people would say to two random tall dudes walking in. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think an appropriate story to tell about Tanner dates back to my very first time going to 2 Mallard Lane. I was just getting used to everything and was sitting on the couch, 
                    probably watching some shows or whatever with the rest of the guys. All of the sudden I hear Tanner make some sort of high pitched shouting noise then begin chanting "DOUBLE YOLK! DOUBLE YOLK!!!" 
                    I thought it was funny, just because of the weird noise and how enthusiastic he was about it, but I've received too many snaps of double yolks from him since to ever forget that.

                <h4 class="text-is-centered">A short story</h4>
                <h4 class="text-is-centered">By: Tanner Graham & Russell Winters</h4>
                <p>
                    It was a regular Sunday afternoon for me. I had a few (too many) drinks Saturday night so I took refuge at my parents’ house where my mom could make me waffles and I could nap in the peace and quiet of 
                    my parents’ house. However, soon after breakfast I received a disturbing voice message out of the blue from Russell Winters that made this day quite memorable (This wasn’t a voicemail or a phone call, this was one of those weird voice messages you can send on 
                    iPhones). At this point in time Russell was basically my third brother. He would come over to our house all the time and chill with my family most weekends. Anyway, this is a direct quote of what Russell 
                    said in the voice message in the most feeble and desperate tone I’ve ever heard him speak: “no food…no water…haaalp”. I had just been drinking with Russell the night before so I was very empathetic to this message, 
                    I think anyone who has ever got drunk has felt how Russell did this morning. However, most people don’t express these emotions over an umprompted voice message to their friends. After hearing this message I’m 
                    thinking I’m sure he’s fine he’ll just ask if he can come to my parent’s place soon to chill as that happened most weekends. But 5 minutes passed and there were no further messages from Russell. Now I’m like ok 
                    he might actually need food, water and help. so, I hop in my car and drive to the residence building (Vic hall) that Russell and I both lived in at the time. When I get there, I give Russ a 
                    call and simply say “I’m outside Vic hall waiting for you” to which he replies something like “what? Why?” and now I’ll let Russell explain the rest of this story.
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    My side of the story is very simple:
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some context, this was over Christmas break during my first year and the story takes place on New Years. I had flown back from New York the week before 
                    and arrived to my residence building to find no hot water in the washrooms, meaning I couldn't take the hot shower I'd been wanting for hours, there was nowhere to order food from, becasue 
                    I had gotten in very late on December 26th, and I was completely alone in Vic Hall. With that in mind, late at night on December 26th, I called Tanner and basically said I had no food, 
                    no hot water so I couldn't shower, and would greatly appreciate it if I could stay at his parents' place with them all. He promptly picked me up and that was that. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Move forward now to New Years Day, I was hanging out with Ross and some other friends in residence when I told this story to them - we were all talking about when we got back to campus afte the break.
                    i lifted my phone to my ear to act like I was calling the Grahams and half-heartedly said food, water, help, as to quickly move along with the story. Little did I know, my phone tapped the 
                    record message button, because my phone was open and I was texting Tanner at the time. Sure enough, 15 minutes later Tanner gives me a call that he's outside waiting for me. At this point, I'm in a t-shirt and sweats. It's -15 outside at least, 
                    and I have absolutely no clue why Tanner is expecting me to be ready to go to his place and makes no mention of Ross, who was sitting there with me. Regardless, we both got ready and went back to the Grahams and soon learned of 
                    the message I had sent. It really was a pathetic message.

                <p>
                   Ah Ah - my guy. Vinny is one of the only people I've ever met that just makes your life better just by saying hey - in whatever fashion he chooses to greet you that day. 
                   He's also one of those people that you meet for the first time and instantly love. He's so positive that it's infectious. That being said, his on-court self-talk was the most hilarious 
                   departure from that positivity I've ever seen. This guy would ask himself questions like "Whyyyyyyy" or just say "Yo bro, what are you doing" to himself. The way he said it too - always made me laugh.   
                </p>
                <p>
                  For real though, he's a guy I can always count on to talk to and a dude who's always great to just chill and talk to. We always studied together in some obscure room on campus during 
                  exams - from year 3 onwards, no joke. Every. single. exam. season. It amused me how routine that was. I have so many hilrious memories of him, but he had a few he wanted to share:
                </p>
                <p>
                    I remember a time when I was going to watch a movie with Russell and Sammy in their student house at 248 Barrie and this house was particularly bad for having rats, which gave rise to the 
                    house nickname as the rat trap. But other than that as I walked into the house and about to get the movie started we heard a rat scampering around. So, we stopped the movie and 
                    tried to find this rat. Somehow we found it running around the main floor and Russell out of no where picks up a brick and throws it at the rat and hits it! 
                    Stunning myself and Sammy since it was very accurate and somewhat impressive! However, the ending was unfortunate for the rat dying instantly upon impact, we disposed of it properly 
                    and laughed about the scenario and later on continued on with our movie.

                    Another good memory of Russell was the beginning of "meep meep". This quote became a salute to seeing Russell. Saying hello or goodbye to him, it could honestly mean anything as long as Russell 
                    was near you. It originated I think from a sound Russell would make and then myself and our teammates coined it as "meep meep". It gave a lot of us a good laugh because sometimes we wouldn't understand words that he 
                    would say because of his accent or honestly just miss something Russ has said and then we would use the term "meep meep' to understand and try to figure out what was meant. And sooner than later it stuck around 
                    an became a part of our conversations.

                    Ahhhhhhh my dude Benry. That's the little bro! Great guy... y'all know the end of the phrase. I'm just happy I got to be a part of your university life my dude. 
                    You're a great friend and I'm glad you chose here over Ryerson, that's for damn sure. I'll make this short, but a few things to note:
                </p>
                <p>
                    0's and 1's babay!! ANybody else remember the time Steph was pissed at someone and yelled "If you want to be a robot, just go into computer science. This is basketball" and 
                    Henry had THE funniest expression/eye roll as a response (it was not directed at him). Also, I think it's safe to say Henry had one of the msot legendary moments when I was at Queen's. 
                    I've never seen anybody get a number dropped in front of them so smoothly, and thank god your girl did that because it been like 2 and a half years now? happy for you two.

                <h2 class="image-label">Jake</h2>
                <p>
                    Hahahahahaha oh god, Jake. Before he came to Queen's I didn't think anybody could get roasted by QMBB as much as me. And I didn't think I needed any more 
                    reason to be embarrased of being American around QMBB. He definitely changed both of those. From saying the Pelicans would win the championship back to back years to Jake the Snake. 
                    he once told me he was so stupid around us because his brain worked to hard when he was studying, so he needed time to let his brain be stupid. I don't doubt that, because despite all of the 
                    ridiculous things he's said, he's crazy book-smart. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reason Jake falls in here is because he was also on the coaching staff with me and dude, that coaching staff of Steph, Greg, Jake and me was hilarious. The road trips and 
                  coaches meetings had some of the funniest moments of fifth year for me, to be honest. Coaching at Queen's wouldn't have been nearly as fun, enjoyable, or worthwhile for me if Jake wasn't on the staff too, 
                  so although I know he would've rather been playing I hope spending that time with me did as much for him as it did for me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jake has a lot of weird quirks. One being his love for Subway. Another is that the dude would wear shorts in any weather. I once walked with him to dinner where he wore 
                    a full winter jacket and shorts. It was -15 Celsius outside. And he had just spend a week in New Orleans, where it was about 30 Celsius.
