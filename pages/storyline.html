                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    This page is about my time at Queen's as a whole. I got out of Queen's everything I wanted to, thinking back 
                    to my visit to Queen's and UofT, and this is kind of an overview of how that happened and what it was that made the 
                    time special to me. Obviously I chose to Queen's for the basketball, but this page is more about the friendships, memories, and 
                    my experiences that were the things I valued while I was at Queen's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I put in a blog post for each year I spent at Queen's - allowing me to reflect on each year seperately, but also the time as a whole. 
                    I added a little gallery section because I wanted to go back and look through some of the photos from the past five years - something that's 
                    always fun, especially when you spent the entire time with the same guys and in the same place (except a week away here and there).

                <h2>Where am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    Hahahaha looking back at it this was a crazy time. I'd just up and left Long Island - knowing that I'd never really spend more than a week back there visiting.
                    I threw myself into a different country, a University environment I was not prepared for, a level of basketball I'd never even seen before, and 
                    a circle of friends that I was meeting on Day 1. It's funny - I still remember my first thoughts of all my housemates, since I knew I'd be with them for 
                    the next five years. I remember thinking Ross was a goofy guy, Sammy was chill, Jesse seemed athletic (LOL) and that Tanner's voice irritated me - all stuff I 
                    find amusing now.
                <p>
                    First year was crazy for me though. I was overwhelmed by school and lsot on the court. I felt like I couldn't do anything, which I remember talking to 
                    the guys about and feeling super motivated to improve and make something of myself. We all felt like that. I had good days and bad days, both in the classroom and 
                    on the court. No matter how that stuff was going I always had my guys to fall back on. That was huge for me. I remember feeling homesick only once and they were a huge reason 
                    why. I could always go to the Graham's place ("Food. Water... Help") and just talk to any of them about how hard this all was. We were all two feet in though - on basketball but 
                    also on each other. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    That year had so much going on that I don't think I can mention everything or even remember a=it all in one sitting, but the most important part of it to me was 
                    that we - the five of us - became really close. Last year, Ross kept saying it was "the end of an era" - when we had to move out of 124. That first year really brough in the 
                    era he was talking about, and it ended with us all moving in together for our first summer together.

                <h2>Tyler's House</h2>
                <p>
                    Holay, should I call it Tyler's House or the Rat Trap?!? I guess at this point it was neither, but the thing that stand out the most to me about that year 
                    was living with the boys. That first summer, sitting up on the roof and getting used to living together. That was the first time I really felt like I was at home in 
                    Kingston. Yea, I lived there during school, but for me it felt like I was actually living in a place that I wanted to be - with people I wanted to be living with. 
                    Without Sammy and Ross that whole summer, and the Graham's spending about half the summer in the student house (before realizing their parents house was 50x better) 
                    I don't know how I would've made it through the summer. That was the start of all my back problems, but also so fun to look back on. We were all jsut figuring it out. 
                    I don't think anybody did dishes for a month. It's safe to say it took a while to figure it out. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The summer wasn't everything though. THe school year was real. Living with the guys during the schoolyear was completely different. Seeing first hand 
                    how everybody worked and spent their free time. Walking downstairs at 7am to find Sammy working on a paper. Hungover Sunday mornings. Figuring out when everybody liked 
                    to leave for practices. Just spending 90% of our time together - it was crazy, but everything I wanted. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dude Vinny also joined the team that year. He's on the contributor's page, but he is the most positive individual I have ever met. We weren't as close that year, 
                    but he was such a great guy to have on the team it was hard not to love the guy from day 1. I was kind of shook he was older than me though - I still wasn't used to the fact that 
                    there's a grade 13 in Ontario.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I guess I also met Henry that year. He would come in the following year, but he stayed with me on his visit. He was the first recruit I was ever in put in charge of, which 
                    worked out great because he committed and Steph took me for lunch the following week because of it. Another one of the fam.

                <h2>Halfway Point</h2>
                <p>
                    This year was craaaaazzzyyyyyyyy. The Rat Trap became the Rat Trap, then Tyler's house. Ross had his knees blessed by our landlord. We had a house elf. 
                    It was the last year we all played on QMBB. It was the last year at 248 Barrie, and living with two extra housemates. Personally, it was the first year I felt like 
                    I actually enjoyed school, and I figured out a lot of things on the court - having the only year where I played significant minutes, especially by the end.                      
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basketball part of this year was mixed for me. It felt great to be playing and to think that I was making a positive contribution to the team, 
                    but we weren't very good, and went through the longest losing streak I've ever been a part of. So it was tough to balance personal progress with the 
                    fact that we jsut weren't very good and needed to improve overall. I didn't want to feel like I was the one holding the team back, even if it did mean I got to 
                    play more. That being said, the basketball isn't the important part of this year - as always.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team was a lot of fun that year. It was the only year I was at Queen's where we had a solid group of older players and also a big group of younger players. 
                    To top it off, everybody got along really well. That wasn't really unique, but it was so nice to feel like my class was right in the middle of all that. We felt like 
                    upper-classmen and it made the year a lot of fun, just hanging around all the guys.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are too many stories, but I think Tyler should be mentioned. That was the year that the Rat Trap became Tyler's house. We had a morning practice the one day 
                    and I woke up to Jesse shouting "We got robbed." Although he was shouting it, there wasn't a lot of urgency in his voice, so I casually got my clothes on and 
                    mentally prepped for practice, wondering what got stolen over the night. WHen I walked downstairs, however, all my housemates were in just their underwear, and I was notified that it was not, in fact, 
                    6 a.m. (like I had assumed) - it was 3:30 a.m. and we were in the process of getting robbed. Sammy was actually out on the street chasing down the robber - Tyler. The story itelf is 
                    way more than that, but the rest of the story is more for Sammy and the rest of the guys to tell. We ended up scouring the surrounding neighbourhood for an hour or so 
                    looking for Tyler and some of our stuff, but only managed to recover a little of it.

            <section class="blog-post">
                <h2>Coaching Sports!</h2>
                <p>
                   I had to make one of the hardest decisions  made at Queen's at the beginning of fourth year. I had just broken my foot and would miss at least the first half of the season. 
                   Before the injury I was unsure of playing during my fifth year, due to all of my injuries - I didn't know if I could take the physical beating I'd racked up over the years. All 
                   my back injuries really scared me, to be honest. The hardest part wasn't if I wanted to make the jump to the coaching staff, which Steph was very supportive of - the hardest part 
                   was making that decision, unsure of how the guys would react and if it would change how they acted around me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking back, it probably did change how they acted around me and what they thought of me, but I decided the best thing was to proceed and give the team everything I 
                    could from my new role. Other than that I just tried to lessen the amount basketball defined me. To that point in my life I had always placed a huge amount of self-worth on my 
                    ability to play basketball, but that was an important part for me because it gave me a buffer period of starting to branch out from that while staying involved with the guys and the sport. 
                    I also knew that I've always wanted to coach basketball and having the University coaching experience would absolutely help that - something that's already proven useful. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Off the court, that was the first year at 124. 124 was definitely the place I'll always look back of when I think of Kingston. Living with just those four other guys: Ross, Sammy, 
                    Tanner and Jesse. THat's what I wanted when I chose Queen's and it was everything I wanted. There were always things to pick at, but at the end of the day I loved coming 
                    home to those guys, and those guys only.

                <p>
                    Damn, the end of an era. I think this was the year that I enjoyed the most. There were definitely things that weren't perfect, and I had my stressors here and there, 
                    but I had a light course-load and tried really hard to just love every minute I had with the boys. I knew I was moving when it was over so I made the most of it, or tried to. 
                    Two things will always define fifth year for me. The back room (@Ross) and Smash Bros Ultimate. Those last few months, chilling as much as possible and playing smash every day made 
                    me really appreciate what we built together at Queen's. Again, I'll always look back and think that I got out of Queen's what I wanted to and my housemates, as well as other guys here and there 
                    made that possible. I'm just happy I got the chance to recognize that in the moments there and didn't let it pass me by.

                    Those family dinners were the best. The taco nights, the steak - whatever we were having it was priceless to get everybody together once a week for a meal and some time to hang out. I'm also really 
                    happy I got to play intramurals with my guys. Playing with Sammy again, and Ross (that one game he went to), as well as Vinny and a bunch of other ex-QMBB dudes. Washed Up Gang was an appropriate 
                    name for that team, but we did win two shirts, lol.
